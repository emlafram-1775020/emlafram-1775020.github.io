	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a sophmore a the Univreristy of Washington hoping to become a Nurse! I am originally from Kirkland Washington which is just across the 520 bridge. I Have grown up in Washington my whole life and am a huge fan of the PNW. I have grown up with three older sisters who I greatly admire.</p>
	<p>A few of my favorite things include, going to the beach, eating pizza (with ranch of course), watching Harry Potter movies, hanging out with family and friends and obsessing over my golden retriver Cooper.</p>
